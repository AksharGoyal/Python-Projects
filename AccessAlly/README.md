As part of the interview, AccessAlly provided a coding assessment.

One of them is about Blood Distribution, which required me to think of ways of certain algorithms to optimally provide blood to almost every patient possible. The main challenge for me was ordering the list of blood groups for a paricular blood group in a way that maximum units of blood could be gained in a way that other blood groups could benefitted too.

The other challenge was checking if there was an arithmetic sequence in an LED 12-hour clock. When I first began the challenge, I considered using nptime module as there was an issue with adding/subtracting timedelta objects to datetime.time objects. But then I realized from the given input and output files that given the large number of minutes, we are not restricted to time but need to consider number of days passed as well!! I realized I will need to work with datetime objects after all.

Both these challenges taught me a lot of optimal algorithm and required number of methods and modules.

Thank you AccessAlly!
