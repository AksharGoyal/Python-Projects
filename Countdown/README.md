# Countdown

The program acts like a timer for you. it will ask for hours, minutes and seconds and the fun thing is they can be any value >= 0.

In the above image, we can see we provide various inputs for our timer and our timer automatically adjusts the time and starts ticking.
Have fun playing with this!

Note: If you ever want to stop the timer or any program, just press Ctrl + C (or Cmd + C).
