# Hangman

Inspired by the popular game Hangman and with the help of freeCodeCamp, I programmed this game called Hangman with the help of random module and knowledge of sets.

A word is selected from word.py and then the player inputs random alphabets.

## Possibility 1

User inputs a letter and it is present in the word. So the output shows the random word with the blanks filled with user's guesses.

## Possibility 2

User inputs a letter and it is not present in the word. So the output will show that the hangman is near to their death.

## Possibility 3

User inputs a symbol or an already guessed word. The output will let the user know that they need to enter again.

# EndGame

After the user has run out of choices, the final output will be the hangman and game over message. If the user has filled the blanks with correct letters, then a vicotry message will be displayed with the correct word.

In the image above, we see that as the user provides letters, the blanks are filled.

I really enjoyed making this game and I hope you will enjoy playing it :)
