# Usage

In order to use this app, you need a valid API which you can borrow from openweather.org (or use mine: ad20e8b80adbc2f3d671f8b5389e784c).
When you use this app, you will provide a city's or a country's name to see their details.

In the above example, I am providing my API, then my 2nd hometown to see the details about Waterloo's weather.

Enjoy playing :)
