# QRCode Generator  

How will you create a QRCode if the internet is down or your app is not working? Luckily, this program helps you create a QRCode as well as decode a QRCode.  

When you run `URL2Code.py`, you will be prompted to enter a URL though it can be anything you want including a word or a sentence. You do need to specify where you want to save it. The code contains 2 versions where one can be used to create a simple QRCode and other version can create a colorful QRCode, like below.

Fyi, the QRCode is legit and you can scan it if you want to. Or, you can use the `QRImageDecoder.py` to decode the message behind the QRCode. You will be prompted to enter the path of the QRCode image and it can be a relative path too.  

Hope you enjoy playing with the program ðŸ˜„
