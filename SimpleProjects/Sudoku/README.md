# Sudoku  

I made this program as part of my class assignment. I have modified it a little to make it look a bit original but I do think there can be a better implementation in future.

The lines at the end of the program do show what kind of input needs to be provided and based on that, the program will decide if the puzzle is solvable or not.  

The best way to see this demonstration is to imagine we have a sudoku puzzle but instead of given inputs, it's completely blank.  
Thus, we have so many opportunities to fill it the way we want. Here is an output we get:
```
True
[[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9],
 [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2, 3],
 [7, 8, 9, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6],
 [2, 1, 4, 3, 6, 5, 8, 9, 7],
 [3, 6, 5, 8, 9, 7, 2, 1, 4],
 [8, 9, 7, 2, 1, 4, 3, 6, 5],
 [5, 3, 1, 6, 4, 2, 9, 7, 8],
 [6, 4, 2, 9, 7, 8, 5, 3, 1],
 [9, 7, 8, 5, 3, 1, 6, 4, 2]]
 ```
 The `True` shows that the puzzle is solvable which indeed it is!
 
 Try creating your own puzzles (use `-1` to denote empty cells) and see if the program can solve it or not.
