# Web Scrapping Github Profiles  

Ever wanted to get links to various Github users' profile pictures?  
The program, with the help of `requests` and `BeautifulSoup`, will output the link to the image of your request Github user.  
So if I run the program, it will ask for a valid Github username and then give you the link like below:  
```
Input Github Username: AksharGoyal
Click on the link to view the profile pic: https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38995624?v=4
```

You can also run a for loop where you can ask for links for various Github Users. Hope you enjoy playing with it ðŸ˜„
