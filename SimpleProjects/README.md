# Simple Projects  

Hello, welcome to my profile ðŸ˜Š  

This repository contains small projects which you can also try to build yourself. The programs I have written will help you understand basic functionality of certain modules, such as random and math which are used frequently.  

Feel free to clone this repository. If you have suggestions, feel free to provide them to me. I am always looking for ways to improve myself and get better than my yesterday self.  

Once again, thank you for visiting.
